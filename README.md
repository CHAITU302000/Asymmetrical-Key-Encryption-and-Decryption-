Use an image as plaintext
Generate the public/private key pair
Feed the image as a sequence of plain-text to carryout encryption
Show me the ciphertext
Feed the ciphertext to the decryption algorithm and recover the image.
Display the recovered image.
Write every functional block by yourself without using any standard libraries.
You may write the source code in any environment - C/C++, JAVA, Matlab, Python etc
Repeat the above steps for ECC as well.
